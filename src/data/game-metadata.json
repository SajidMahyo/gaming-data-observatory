Players assume command of an army that's out to reclaim a world that's been broken up by warring factions. The battle map is essentially a grid, and moving units is like moving chess pieces on a board -- each of the units can move a specific amount of spaces within this grid, and can only attack at a certain distance from specific enemies. Advance Wars features more than 115 maps, a map editor, head-to-head play via link cable, and an easy-to-understand tutorial mode for beginners.",

Players assume the role of a customisable character known as the Tarnished, who must explore this world, battle formidable enemies, and seek to restore the Elden Ring to become the Elden Lord.\n\nThe game builds on the challenging gameplay mechanics familiar from the Dark Souls series but introduces a more open-ended structure with vast exploration, dynamic weather, and a day-night cycle. It offers deep lore, complex characters, and an interconnected world filled with secrets, dungeons, and powerful bosses.",

    "igdb_summary": "Tyria\u2019s leaders are anxious about rumors of covert Inquest voyages launched in search of the island of Castora, an island so remote that it\u2019s long been thought to be inaccessible\u2014or even nonexistent. The risks involved prevent all but the most tenacious (and perhaps foolhardy) of pursuers from investigating the Inquest\u2019s plan. Your race to discover the Inquest\u2019s plot will lead you across two new open world regions at launch, each filled with magical energies and strange creatures. Two additional maps will open as the story continues over the course of a year.\n\nDuring your travels, you\u2019ll unlock three new Mastery tracks, including one for your Skimmer mount that will unlock new and updated abilities. The new region also brings new adventures, collections, and thematic rewards. Players who own both Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity and Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds will be able to unlock a new Castoran Homestead map.\n\nA new elite specialization for each profession will unlock new traits, profession mechanics, and healing, utility, and elite skills. Further augment your build by acquiring new relics themed to your adventures in Castora. And work towards six legendary rewards: three new legendary weapons, plus a ring, accessory, and aquabreather.\n\nThe magically infused landscape of Castora is home to all manner of strange, warped wildlife. Two of the three major updates coming in 2026 will pit players against the most powerful of the island\u2019s denizens in Raid Encounters (including Challenge Modes and a Legendary Mode) and a new Convergence. Along with the first of the new Raid Encounters, new system updates will make raids easier to access. A Fractal with an accompanying Challenge Mode will also release with the last of the major expansion updates.\n\nNew emotes, armors, weapons, recipes, and other unique rewards await those who brave the dangers of Castora, and seasonal Wizard\u2019s Vault refreshes throughout the expansion will bring additional options for unique aesthetic rewards.\n\nTo support the addition of a new Homestead map, we\u2019re introducing two additional features. The first, the ability to freely swap between the Janthiri and Castoran maps, is helped by the second feature, Layouts. Layouts create a file you can use to save, load, share, and edit arrangements of decorations. We\u2019ll share more about these and other features as we get nearer to the launch of Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity.",

In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.",

It is a platformer with puzzle-solving elements, focusing on the portrayal of a weak, underpowered character in a grim and hostile world, who has to rely on his cunning to outwit enemies and overcome hazards. The game has pre-rendered background graphics and uses CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.\n\nThe main character Abe is almost completely helpless: he cannot use weapons and is usually instantly killed by his brutal enemies if he confronts them directly. For this reason, most of the game involves careful exploration, timed movement, sneaking, and outsmarting the foes through various means: throwing stones to confuse them, luring them into traps, etc. Abe can run, jump, climb, tiptoe, crouch, and roll; in most areas these actions are essential to his survival. A few stages involve Abe riding a large animal known as Elum.\n\nAbe's only special power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while or possess them. When Abe possess an enemy he gains his abilities: for example, possessing the body or a ferocious Slig allows the player to shoot from his machine gun, communicate with other creatures of his kind, and even commit suicide, clearing the way for Abe.",

Inside, a freshly dug 11 levels maze features the treacherous Terrace of Terror, the dangerous Rotating Dungeon, the Sunken Ruins of Lost Spirits, torture chambers and creature filled caves. Use your whip like a grappling hook and swing past hundreds of traps and a host of ghost freaks, living corpses and hidden goblins. All while dodging or destroying the unpredictable spitting lizards, carnivorous coffins, and more.\nFind the concealed weapons needed to defeat everything from eerie phantoms to haunted furniture. Then prepare to find yourself face-to-thing with hideous torments like the Tongue Lasher, the Darkest Knight, the Bone-Afide Horseman and the Granite Crusher. When your nerves get shot, use your password and take a breather. But forge on, Simon Belmont, because if you though Dracula was down for the count, he's only just begun to fright!",

It was one of the most highly anticipated games of its age, and is listed among the greatest video games ever created by numerous websites and magazines. The gameplay of Ocarina of Time was revolutionary for its time, it has arguably made more of an impact on later games in the series than any of its predecessors even though they had the same cores of exploration, dungeons, puzzles and item usage. Among the gameplay mechanics, one of the most noteworthy is the time-traveling system. The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well and each of them has certain unique abilities. Ocarina of Time also introduces the use of music to solve puzzles: as new songs are learned, they can be used to solve puzzles, gain access to new areas and warp to different locations. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games but they are not too complex.",
